# Financials Sector

**Insurance stocks** have been outperforming the broader market since the beginning of the year. In the week ending on Feb. 4, S&P 500 Insurance index rose 3.72% to 565.68, while the S&P 500 climbed 1.55% to 4,500.53.

Recent releases of Q4’21 earnings reveal that **payment companies**, such as Visa, Mastercard, American Express and DFS, recorded double-digit EPS growth (29%, 35%, 24% and 41%, respectively). The increase in cross-border volume transactions was presented as a justification for such as increase. Oppositely, 67% of the **specialty finance companies** that have reported 2021 fourthquarter earnings saw year-over-year declines in their EPS.

The **bank M&A landscape** has observed lower average-size transactions in the first months of 2022 compared with the 2021 average. However, more deals are likely on the horizon as several U.S. banks executives recently revealed that they are interested in pursuing M&A opportunities during 2022. Furthermore, this year we have already witnessed Bank First’s announcement of a $118.0 million deal to acquire Denmark Bancshares (two Wisconsin-based banks).

**US bank** earnings are expected to fall double digits this year as the sharp decrease in reserves in 2021 (as a way to ease the recession caused by the COVID 19 pandemics) will create challenging yearover-year comparisons in 2022. However, FED is expected to raise short-term interest rates, as an effort to combat inflation, which will boost banks' net interest margins and positively impact 2022 earnings.

## This Week in Game-Fi 

Facebook’s recent rebrand to ‘META’ triggered a surge in interest in ‘the metaverse’ and its prospects as a virtual reality. Game-Fi consists of the play to earn models that combine gaming and cryptocurrencies – an interpretation of bringing the metaverse to fruition. 

This week saw media DAO (Decentralised Autonomous Organisation) Pixel Vault secure $100 million in funding[^2] from venture capitalists Velvet Sea Ventures[^3] (VSV) and Adam Bain and Dick Costolo’s 01 Advisors. Projects that VSV have invested in previously include Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat, Pinterest and Square. 

GameStop received a grant of $100 million from Ethereum layer 2 network ImmutableX as part of a joint venture to build an NFT marketplace in the form of their $IMX token. GameStop were then seen to sell $42 million worth of this grant, seeing the $IMX token fall 30% to $2.80[^4].
