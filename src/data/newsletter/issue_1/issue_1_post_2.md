Financials Review 

**Insurance  stocks**  have  been outperforming  the  broader  market  since  the beginning of the year. In the week ending on Feb. 4, S&P 500 Insurance index rose 3.72% to 565.68, while the S&P 500 climbed 1.55% to 4,500.53.  

Recent  releases  of  Q4’21  earnings  reveal  that **payment companies**, such as Visa, Mastercard, American  Express  and  DFS,  recorded  double- digit  EPS  growth  (29%,  35%,  24%  and  41%, respectively).  The  increase  in  cross-border volume  transactions  was  presented  as  a justification for such as increase. Oppositely, 67% of  the  **specialty  finance  companies**  that  have reported 2021 fourth-quarter earnings saw year- over-year declines in their EPS.  

**US  bank**  earnings  are  expected  to  fall  double digits this year as the sharp decrease in reserves in 2021 (as a way to ease the recession caused by the COVID 19 pandemics) will create challenging year-over-year  comparisons  in  2022. However, FED  is  expected  to  raise  short-term  interest rates, as an effort to combat inflation, which will boost banks' net interest margins and positively impact 2022 earnings.  

This Week in Game-Fi  

Facebook’s  recent  rebrand  to  ‘META’ triggered a surge in interest in ‘the metaverse’ and  its  prospects  as  a  virtual  reality.  Game-Fi consists of the play to earn models that combine gaming and cryptocurrencies- an interpretation of bringing the metaverse to fruition.

enthusiastic about this split from the psychological boost of being able to purchase full shares at lower prices to increase in liquidity for traders.  

Arguably  the  most  interesting  boost  has  been speculation about Google’s potential inclusion in the Dow  Jones  Industrial  Average  (DJIA).  Google replacing IBM in the index may be seen as the logical move since they are both tech companies and would have similar stock prices, which wouldn’t drastically shake-up the weighting of the share price weighted DJIA. 

The battle between mega cap tech companies to get ahead  in  the  Metaverse  has  been  intriguing  with Microsoft agreeing to purchase Activision Blizzard in an all-cash deal worth $68.7 billion. Meta has been investing  aggressively  in  the  Metaverse  with  their Reality Labs reporting a $10 billion loss in 2021 in their quest for domination in the space.  

![](Aspose.Words.09f41634-1645-4d09-8900-9f0dbeabaeda.009.jpeg)

Apple has hinted at breaking into the Metaverse with Augmented Reality (AR) products, with their CEO Tim Cook saying, “We see a lot of potential in this space and are investing accordingly”. 

Rates 

On Thursday 3rd February, the Monetary Policy Committee at the Bank of England (BoE) voted to increase interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5%. This historic rise was the first back-to-back hike  seen  since  2004,  following  on  from  the previous  hike  from  0.1%  in  January. Hikes  are expected to continue as early as April, with the BoE  forecasting  an  increase  to  0.75%.  These 

hikes  come  after  a  hawkish  market  and continued surge in inflation, with CPI expected to reach  6%  by  April  in  the  UK.  GILT  yields  with some  implications  as  catastrophic  as  Pret-a- manger increasing their subscription service by 25%.  

In  Europe,  the  European  Central  Bank  have declined  to  rule  out  a  rate  rise  this  year  but continue  to  take  a  dovish  stance  on  inflation holding rates at 0%. The Federal Reserve, after remaining  initially  dovish,  have  started  to indicate that a rate rise may now be appropriate, with  a  rate  hike  expected  as  early  as  March, which would mark the first since 2018.

Pocket Network, a Key Player in Web3? 

With the advent of Web3 and increased mainstream  adoption  of  Web3  comes  a challenge, notably coordinating the interactions between  blockchains  and  applications.  Pocket Network, launched on the 6th of January 2022, aims  to  serve  as  an  API  (Application Programming Interface) router to mitigate this challenge by enabling seamless interactions. 

**Overview of Technology** 

Pocket  Network  (POKT)  sits  at  number 2903  by  market  cap  as  of  February  2022 according  to  CoinMarketCap[^4]. utilises  Proof  of Stake  (PoS)  like  Ethereum  as  opposed  to  the 

Proof of Work (PoW) used by Bitcoin. Here, the token owners can stake/ pledge their coins and have them validated by a validator. The protocol selects  a  validator  who  adds  a  new  block  of transactions. This is cost and energy-effective.   

The  aim  is  to  coordinate  interactions  and distribute data at scale. This will allow all apps built on blockchains to run more smoothly than previously  thought.  Pocket  Network  aims  to serve  as  a  two-sided  marketplace  for  node developers  (on  the  blockchain  side)  and developers (on the application side) , who can exchange  information  without permission. The start-up is now being supported by the Algorand Network,  which  connects  developers  to decentralised relay networks[^5].  

The ecosystem consists of a Pocket Portal, (the main product) as well as PocketJS which is more customisable.  A  pocket  wallet  and  Pocket Explorer (search engine) are also on offer.  

**Tokenomics**  

Staking the POKT token is used for both running validator nodes and receiving network throughput.  Naturally,  there  are  fees  for processing transactions and storing the data.   Pocket  Network  initially  launched in  July  2020 with 650M POKT tokens using a dynamic reward system. Here, the rewards relate to the number of relays and transaction fees in a given block. 89%  of  this  goes  service  nodes,  1%  goes  to validator  nodes,  and  10%  goes  to  the  Pocket Network DAO[^6]. 

The demand for the POKT token depends upon the number of apps built upon the blockchain network  and  the  amount  of  data  transferred between the apps and the network. 

The supply of the POKT token is fixed at 650M POKT. Hence the value of Pocket Network should appreciate until a point where an equilibrium is reached between the amount of data transferred 

and the supply, at which Pocket Network may become a stable coin.  

**Future Use Case and Team** 

Pocket  Network  operates  as  an infrastructure  project  meaning  that  it  has  the potential to consistently increase in value in the long term. The aim is to minimise the cost for application developers and increase the value of full node operators.  

The team consists of former iOS developers who found  inconsistencies  accessing  decentralised networks  when  using  Ethereum,  due  to  the limited number of centralised service providers. Unlike meme coin developers, the team aims to develop this platform for use in the long term. Though one risk is the CEO Michael P O'Rourke does  not  have  a  technical  (STEM)  academic background8.  

**Risks**  

Whilst  the  technology  behind  this initiative is impressive and the future use cases seem promising, the future value depends on the adoption  of  POKT.  If  applications  built  on Ethereum  and  Solana  networks  do  not  face challenges  with  speed  and  data  transfer,  then the need for Pocket Network’s services will not be present. Secondly, it remains to be observed whether a new player will aim to enter the data distribution and API routing space. Should a new player enter with more robust technology, then Pocket  Network’s  adoption  will  be  reduced, providing a lower return on investment.   

**The Bottom Line - Should I Invest?** 

At the time of writing (4th February 2022), Pocket  network  is  currently  valued  at  $1.26, which  puts  it  in  similar  brackets  to  the  well- known Cardano (ADA) coin. Having fallen from its initial high post-launch, and the lack of current competitors, it may be an ideal time to invest before an increasing number of applications are built  on  the  numerous  blockchain  networks. However,  as  with  all  cryptocurrency

investments, one should appreciate that there is a risk of losing their investment and hence one should only invest within their means.  

Real Estate 

With  2022  well  underway,  news headlines  in  the  real  estate  sector  were  filled with the fallout from the Evergrande fiasco which commenced at the end of last year.  

Evergrande  Real  Estate,  a  subset  of  the Evergrande Group, owned over 1,300 projects in more  than  280  cities  across  China  with  the overall  company  expanding  rapidly  in  recent years  to  become  one  of  China’s  largest companies by borrowing more than $300bn.  

Following  new  rules  brought  in  by  Beijing  to control  the  amount  owned  by  big  real  estate developers, Evergrande was forced to offer its properties at a major discount to resulting in the company struggling to meet interest payments. The biggest ever collapse of a property developer sparked a domestic crisis in China and has now lead  to  Oaktree  Capital  seizing  one  of Evergrande’s most-prized assets.  

![](Aspose.Words.09f41634-1645-4d09-8900-9f0dbeabaeda.011.jpeg)

The  asset  management  firm  now  controls  the sprawling “Venice” residential development due to Evergrande’s default on a $400m loan and is set to restart construction and begin selling its apartments soon.  

As for Evergrande, the developer announced this week that it is aiming to propose a preliminary restructuring proposal within six months which 

may seem like a glimmer of hope for offshore bond investors with around $20bn in exposure.  

Sustainable Investing – Market Summary 

This  week,  topics  such  as  shareholder activism,  clean  energy  transition  and  green quantitative  easing  are  taking  the  headlines. Here’s a quick overview of the market news:  

**Climate Activists Poised to See Big Gains in 2022**  

Investor activism both in and out of the boardroom  is  poised  to  reach  new  heights  in 2022. Last year, shareholder activists teamed up with  environmental  and  socially-minded investors  in  record  numbers.  More  than  nine campaigns  seeking  increased  sustainability  are underway, and this year’s targets include some of the world’s biggest companies.

**BlackRock’s Fink Rejects Accusations of Being ‘Woke’**  

Investors that focus on the interests of wider  society  rather  than  pure  profits  are  not “woke”, BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink has said  after  stinging  attacks  from  US  conservatives. The  head of  the  world’s  largest asset  manager,  which  last  week  crossed  the $10tn  mark for the first time, used his annual corporate  missive  to  chief  executives  to  fight back  against  accusations  that  BlackRock  was using its influence to push a progressive agenda.

**Battered Clean Energy Stocks May Soon Recover**  

Two  indexes  that  track  the  sector— WinderHill Clean Energy and S&P Global Clean Energy—have  dropped  13.9%  and  8.2%, respectively,  since  the  start of  the  year. From their  market  peaks  of  early  last  year,  the WinderHill index  has  plummeted 54%  and  the S&P index has declined 39%.  

**BOE Push to Green Quantitative Easing Isn’t Working, Study Shows**  

U.K.  Chancellor  of  the  Exchequer  Rishi Sunak said last March he wanted to embed the country’s climate laws into policymaking at the Bank of England. He gave a mandate for officials to  consider  net-zero  goals  in  future  policy. However,  under  current  plans,  the  carbon intensity of the BOE’s portfolio would fall by just 7% this year, the research shows. That’s a far cry from the 25% target the BOE set itself for  

\2025.

The Latest Surge in the NFT Market  

With  there  being  a  large  dip  in  the general cryptocurrency market with coins such as  Bitcoin  but also  many  altcoins  experiencing one of the longest and largest bear markets for a long  time.  However,  one  aspect  of  the cryptocurrency industry that has survived and is actually still flourishing from 2021 into 2022 is the NFT market. 

We have seen many new projects in the form of NFTs with Youtubers as well as sports stars all 

entering  the  market.  This  has  meant  the  total market  value  of  NFTs  has  remained  stable  at around $35 - $40 billion and investment banks such  as  Jeffries  are  projecting  the  market  to reach $80 billion by 2025. 

NFTs have been immensely popular in the last six months  and  this  has  been  highlighted  by  the creation of the Metaverse. Not only NFTs in the form  of  digital  art,  but  those  that  have  some forms  of  ‘utility’  are  becoming  ever  more common  in  NFT  marketplaces  due  to  the increasing number of GameFi projects, offering in-game items in the from of NFTs that players can trade. One of high-profile example of this is Bored  Ape  Yacht  Club  collection  which announced a mobile play-and-earn game for the NFT holders. 

Not only individuals, but also many mainstream companies  are  getting  into  the  NFT  action  in order  to  capitalise  on  this  new  market.  With Coachella  offering  lifetime  festival  passes  as NFTs, and GameStop recently announcing their partnership with Immutable X to build an NFT marketplace for games, it seems many people are worried that NFTs could takeover how we transact and  consume  a  lot of  our  digital  and physical  products  in  the  coming  months  and years. 

![](Aspose.Words.09f41634-1645-4d09-8900-9f0dbeabaeda.013.jpeg)

However,  it  has  not  been  all  sunshine  and rainbows when it comes to NFTs. The US treasury has recently suggested that due to the nature of NFTs, they are perfect for money laundering. The 

high values of many NFTs, and the fact they are digital assets means they can be sold peer-to- peer,  or  even  tracking  a  wallet  to  a  specific person is quite difficult. This announcement has also  come  when  European  officials  are considering  how  to  regulate  NFTs,  with  there being possible taxation laws coming in the near future. 

Is Bitcoin Working in El Salvador? 

For those who are not aware, the country of El Salvador based in Central America passed legislation  in  2021  that  allowed  Bitcoin  to  be used  as  legal  tender  in  the  country  after September of that year.  

This  was  met  with  a  lot  of  controversy,  with believers in the crypto space praising it as the first bold step by a country towards a world with an  entirely  decentralised  financial  system. However, many other countries disagreed with the move, and have rejected the idea of the use of cryptocurrencies in their nation. 

The latest twist in this story of El Salvador and Bitcoin  has  come  from  the  International Monetary  Fund  (IMF),  releasing  a  statement asking  El  Salvador  to  remove  Bitcoin’s  legal tender status. This comes after reports from the IMF  shows  that  the  adoption  of  Bitcoin  as  a currency in the country has cost them 1% of their GDP.  

![](Aspose.Words.09f41634-1645-4d09-8900-9f0dbeabaeda.014.jpeg)

They also state that with the volatile prices of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as we have 

seen over the past few months, it may lead to great risks and financial instability in the country. However, many advocates for the use of Bitcoin state it has only been six months, and we must wait  longer  to  see  what  the  full  effects  of adopting this cryptocurrency will have on the El Salvador economy.  

Moreover,  an  Ark  Investment  Management report  issued  in  late  January  recounted  that crypto adoption had soared in the country. “An estimated  3.8  million  people  use  El Salvador’s Bitcoin wallet, Chivo, suggesting 84% adoption among  eligible  citizens.”  Therefore,  it  is  no surprise that El Salvador have rejected the IMF’s call. 

Market Overview 

**Key Market Drivers**  

Interest Rates, Inflation, Tech Earnings  

**Pre-Market**  

Equity  markets  have  proved  volatile  over  the past few weeks as investors weighed up the Fed’s hawkish  prompts  and  geopolitical  tensions between  Russia  and  Ukraine  (threatening  gas supplies  from  Russia  and  US  military involvement).  The  S&P500  index  had  dropped more than 5% during 2022, its worst start to the year since the financial crisis.  

Jay  Powell  (Chair  of  the  Federal  Reserve) signalled that the US central bank was ready to raise  rates  from  record  lows  to  tackle  soaring inflation.  This  has  led  to  fearful  market conditions  as  investors  consider  potential interest rate rise trajectories; Bank of America’s outlook seems to be the most pessimistic with 8 quarter-point interest rate hikes predicted this year (2% rise).  

![](Aspose.Words.09f41634-1645-4d09-8900-9f0dbeabaeda.015.jpeg)

**Markets this week**  *Monday*  

S&P index   +1.9%  Nasdaq Composite    +3.4%  UK100   +0.15%  

US  equities  rose  on  Monday  in anticipation of financial reports from tech giants Alphabet,  Amazon,  and  Meta.  With  markets facing  uncertainty  around  tighter  monetary conditions  and  mixed  fourth-  quarter  results, Apple  and  Microsoft’s  upbeat  results  the previous  week  encouraged  investors  that  the rest  of  the  tech  titans  could  beat  analyst expectations.  

Movements in European treasury bond markets signalled  that  traders  are  betting  on  the European Central Bank to join the global move towards tighter monetary policy by raising rates before the end of the year. Two rate rises of 0.1% have  been  priced  into  bond  markets  by December for the ECB.  

*Tuesday*  

Strong  earnings  reports  from  Alphabet and  chipmaker  AMD  drove  optimistic  investor outlook for the tech sector with Alphabet and AMD  shares  rising  8%  and  5.1%  respectively. Paypal, however, showed a 25% hit to the share price following lower full-year revenue guidance than analysts had expected.  

Markets had priced in about five quarter-point interest rate rises (from the current rate of close to 0) by the end of the year for the US. However, a  weak  ADP  report  showing  that  US  private sector  jobs  fell  by  an  unexpected  301,000  in January  underlined  hopes  of  the  Fed  moving more slowly with interest rate advances.  

Meanwhile in Europe, Germany’s treasury bond yield  (Bund)  rose  to  0.04%  in  response  to  a record rise in eurozone inflation.  

*Thursday*  

S&P index   -2.4%  Nasdaq Composite    -3.7%  UK100   0.0%  

Disappointing earnings from Meta parent Facebook sent shock through markets, especially the Nasdaq due to it’s tech-heavy nature. This led US equities to have their worst day in almost a year.  

Meta’s  share  price  decreased  by  26.4%  and dragged with it companies such as PayPal who faced a further 6% loss on the week. With drivers such  as  the  pandemic  and  high  monetary stimulus  fading,  traders  were  also  quick  to punish Snapchat and Amazon following Meta’s decline.

Fortunatly  for  crypto  ‘hodlers’,  this  week  has shown some strong resistance, with Metaverse coins  leadining  the  rally.  This  seems counterintuative with the recent news of Meta’s poor earning reports, where ¼ of the companies marketcap was wiped out in a single day. The rally  may  be  due  to  investors  seeing  this  as  a ‘flash  sale’,  as  Meta  has  yet  to  launch  any product yet.

The recent ralley may also come  as a surprise as ETH and SOL were in the news this week, with a reportedly 320 million dollars stolen through an infinate  loop,  taking  advantage  of  liquidity farmers.  

As of writing this crypto markets ends the week by  gaining  over  $160  billion  as  Bitcoin  holds strong above $40k13.
