## Consumer Discretionary Sector {#consumer}

Companies in the consumer discretionary sector sell nonessential goods and services, such as appliances, cars, and entertainment. Consumer discretionary companies like Nike tend to be more sensitive to the overall business cycle because consumers are more likely to reduce or postpone discretionary purchases when times are tough. Therefore, discretionary stocks outperform the overall market during economic expansions, but they underperform it during economic contractions.

By contrast, companies in the consumer staples sector like Walmart sell essential items such as food and beverages, which are less sensitive to business cycles.

The Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLY) is down 10% in the last 30 days, primarily caused by concerns regarding high inflation in conjunction with market fears over rising interest rates. This has negatively impacted consumer sentiment towards spending on non-essential items as prices of goods increase, thus decreasing consumer spending.

Consumer discretionary stocks are currently the most shorted sector, with short-sellers holding 4.6% of their shares, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. That is more than double the S&P 500 average of 2.1%. Investors are betting that stocks that benefited from a spending binge by consumers are poised to cool off.

## Healthcare Summary (last 2-3 months) {#healthcare}

As a sector that has been widely seen as one of the winners of the pandemic, it may come as a surprise that drug development M&A activity over the past year has fallen to its lowest level in a decade. This comes following increased scrutiny from the US federal trade commissionand regulatory bodies in Europe as they look to keep a handle on soaring drug prices. In particular, this trend has impacted the attractiveness of biotech firms which have previously been takeover targets for Big Pharma companies looking to boost their pipeline prospects. This is in contrast with the wider healthcare industry (including medical devices, equipment companies etc.), which has seen a boom in activity with deals amounting to almost $300bn – the second highest level in two decades.

One recent potential acquisition that will not be happening is Unilever’s bid to acquire GSK’s consumer healthcare division.

The UK based consumer goods conglomerate had valued the division at $50bn – an amount deemed by GSK to have “fundamentally undervalued” its consumer business. A further attempt was made by Unilever to increase it’s bid to $68billion, however, following a leak, the approach was rejected by its own shareholders. GSK had originally planned to spin-off its consumer division by mid-2022.

Finally, a last highlight includes Oracle’s $28.3bn all cash acquisition of leading healthcare information systems company Cerner.

Cerner provides digital healthcare systems in hospitals that aid medical professionals in providing better healthcare to patients. This is the latest move in Big Tech’s push to enter the healthcare industry and follows Microsoft’s $19.7bn acquisition of Nuance Systems earlier in 2021, a leading player in conversational AI and clinical intelligence for healthcare providers.

## Energy and Utilities Summary (last 2-3 months) {#energy}

The sector saw an increase in gas prices attributed to declining European LNG production and the tension between Russia and the West – Putin might weaponise gas supply as leverage.

Russia’s majority state-owned energy giant Gazprom will lose around $20bn if Russia goes ahead with the invasion; this was reflected in a 14% drop in the company’s stock price in the past month. The Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem) in the UK, has also announced a rise in energy price cap, which is the maximum price suppliers in England, Wales and Scotland can charge households. This would allow suppliers to pass on costs, offsetting the effect of high gas prices.

The surge in oil prices has continued from Q3 of 2021, this was driven by fears of the Russian invasion, supply disruptions, increased demand and decreased supply due to OPEC+ restraining production.

Crude oil prices were up more than 15% in January alone; with the global benchmark price exceeding $90/barrel – a price last seen in 2015. This has contributed to gains in Chinese crude oil stocks such as China National Petroleum Corporation and China Oilfield Services; Rosneft, Russia’s biggest oil producer, also achieved record profits.

## Transport Sector {#transport}

Over the past weeks, the transport sector continues to be dominated by 2 key factors – the omicron variant, and global supply chain issues.

Airlines continue to see their revenue haemorrhage at least until the summer, especially for low-cost carrier operators. Wizz Air and EasyJet both announced a major dent in bookings for the winter but are hoping for a summer recovery.

The pandemic has been a huge blow for low cost carrier operators in general as not only have flights reduced, but purchase of accessory items (e.g. food on flights), where they earn a huge percentage of their revenue, has plummeted proportionally.

Looking at the longer time horizons, there could be more headwinds for major airlines as looming increased costs of carbon emissions could scuttle further profits for airlines. In addition, newer innovations such as self-flying air taxis (which Boeing just committed an extra $450m to) could eat into the market share of traditional commercial airliners.

In contrast, shipping had a record breaking $150b year in 2021, and is expected to continue to soar through this year. However, there may be some downward pressure incoming in 2022.

Firstly, due to supply chain woes, port traffic has slowed. Major ports in the U.S. couldn’t process imports fast enough, trucking companies fell short on drivers, and warehouses ran out of space. Secondly, the substantial rise in transportation has stoked inflation with economist Nicholas Sly (KC Fed) estimating a 15% increase in shipping costs led to 0.1% inflation after a year. The worrisome part is that this effect is persistent, not just transitory, meaning shipping companies could be hampered by regulatory bodies down the line.

## Algorand Deep Dive {#algorand}

### About

The Algo is the native token of the Algorand blockchain, a proof-of-stake consensus that powers the Algorand blockchain. It claims to be scalable and super-fast with every transaction complete in roughly 4 seconds.

The total max supply is 10 billion with 66% in circulating suplpy. The current price, as of 13th February 2022 at 2:24, is $0.9207 with a market cap of $6.1 billion.

Coinmarketcap.com describes the coin as “a self-sustaining, decentralized, blockchain-based network that supports a wide range of applications […] Algorand will support computations that require reliable performance guarantees to create new forms of trust.

### New CEO

Algorand foundation appoints JPMorgan, Nasdaq, Milken Institute and US Tresury Department alumni Staci Warden.

“By both ratcheting up our global ambitions as well as doubling down on our commitment to the DeFi ecosystem, I know that we will deliver tremendous value for both the Algorand ecosystem as a whole and the end-users it supports,” she said in a statement.

Warden also noted transaction fees are 0.001 ALGO and the blockchain processes at 1,000 transactions per second. Competing blockchain Solana is processing more than 2,000 transactions per second at a cost of $0.00025 per transaction, according to the blockchain’s website.

## Gaming Guilds {#gaming}

With the prevalence of Game-Fi, a sector of play to earn models monetarily incentivising users to play games, the entry cost for prospective gamers to enter the big names such as Axie Infinity has subsequently risen beyond a price attainable for many. These costs are incurred mainly due to the NFTs that need to be purchased in order to compete which come in the form of playable characters and items. Game guilds, usually in the form of DAOs, aim to capitalise on this by offering gamers the resources needed to compete in these games in exchange for a percentage of their earnings.

Whilst the functionality of these entities vary slightly from guild to guild, from an investment standpoint, these guilds and their tokens can be thought of as index funds for metaverse related projects; their popularity amongst VCs comes from this utility.

Last year saw one such gaming guild, GuildFi, receive $6 million in seed funding ‘co-Led by DeFinance Capital and Hashed’ and additionally backed by names such as Coinbase Ventures. On Feb 12/22, they secured additional investment from Binance Smart Chain’s $1B Fund.

Sustained investment from big name VCs has correlated with their rise in gaming scholars to 3,100 with a 20,000 scholar waiting list and over 1 million quests completed between them. Their current market cap stands at $88,907,004.50 (as of 12/02/22).

## Russia, Ukrain and Crypto Markets {#russia}

### Executive Summary

A Russian invasion of Ukraine would devalue cryptocurrencies due to the lack of confidence from investors and increased uncertainty. This would likely shock the stock market, which in turn would in turn hurt the cryptocurrency market. This is increasingly likely given the recent direct correlation between both the stock and cryptocurrency markets.

### Introduction

As increased uncertainty on the Russian-Ukrainian border looms, cryptocurrencies could see either a continued sidewards trend, a boom or a sharper collapse than the fall witnessed after the federal reserve revealed its plans to taper the buying of corporate bonds. Here we will discuss the key factors at play, and evaluate the likelihood of potential outcomes.

### Key Factors at play

1. Confidence in cryptocurrencies as an alternative investment strategy

In times of political and economic strife, individuals may see cryptocurrencies as a safe bet. Whilst this sounds counterintuitive, the principle of cryptocurrencies largely lies within holding digital assets in a decentralised fashion. In theory, this makes these assets independent of the typical controlling powers, namely governments and banks. An invasion of Ukraine would result in additional economic sanctions placed on Russia and a cease of trade, likely resulting in the Ruble falling, encouraging Russians to buy cryptocurrencies. A similar trend is observed in the developing countries in central America where a lack of trust in the government has resulted in a renewed interest in cryptocurrencies.

Some go as far to speculate that crypto-currencies may be the ‘gold of the future’ where people will hoard cryptocurrency assets in times of uncertainty. However with the ability to purchase items still limited, the need for fiat currency remains ever-present.

2. The coupled relationship between the cryptocurrency market and the stock market

Looking at recent trends in both markets, we see a tight coupling between the cryptocurrency and stock markets. This was reflected in the post pandemic boom where both S&P 500 and cryptocurrencies rallied and the subsequent downturns more recently pertaining to the federal reserves tapering. It must be noted however that

3. The risk appetite of investors

In times of uncertainty, most stocks and cryptocurrency investors to sell their positions to avoid the risk of holding on to a rapidly devaluing portfolio. Emotions of both types of investors are largely similar and hence there will likely be an immediate drop in cryptocurrency valuations should an invasion occur. The extent to which this occurs however depends on whether investors have a high risk appetite and are willing to bear the storm, or if they will follow the trend and sell their positions.

4. A Russian crackdown on Bitcoin mining

A Russian invasion would likely result in Russia attempting to enforce it’s power in the region. Hence it may crackdown on bitcoin which it may deem to be illegal. The Chinese crackdown on bitcoin mining areas in May 2020 is largely credited with the sudden decline in the cryptocurrency market, and hence we may observe a similar outcome.

### The bottom line

Evaluating the above factors, it is likely that the additional uncertainty generated by an invasion will result in a fall in cryptocurrency prices. This may be offset by increased cryptocurrency adoption but will be limited by the few current use-cases. Given the way both the markets have moved synchronously, a Russian invasion of Ukraine could result in an accentuated bear market for cryptocurrency investors.

## The Emerging Interests and Scepticism Towards Rapidly Advancing Metaverse {#emergingmarkets}

Metaverse and its related GameFi have been one of the hottest sectors of crypto market since last year. It continues to progress despite of the recent bearish market conditions, as large companies and even nations show their interests on metaverse. However, criticisms and scepticisms also evolve around metaverse, focusing on its increasing hype.

On 1st of February, Saudi Arabia announced that the nation will invest $1 billion into NEOM Tech & Digital Company – a firm that is planning to establish its own metaverse. This is part of the nation’s plan to diversify its economy through encouraging the development of futuristic technologies. Turkey has also shown its interest in metaverse. In January, Turkish president Erdoğan held meetings with his ruling party and ordered research towards the recent development in cryptocurrency and particularly metaverse, as he believes ‘this is a delicate matter and should be looked at thoroughly’. In a statement by Turkish Communication Technologies President, it was said that ‘Turkey has accelerated its Metaverse efforts’.

Warner Music Group announced on 27th of January that it is opening a virtual theme park in the Sandbox Metaverse. The park will provide live concerts and other music related experience. This partnership could potentially bring some of the famous artists represented by Warner Music Group (such as Ed Sheeran and Dua Lipa) into the metaverse. In the same week, Fidelity sent in an application for its Metaverse ETF which will track publicly listed companies with metaverse exposure. Fidelity is not the only firm aiming to create Metaverse ETF – ProShares also filed an Metaverse ETF application to SEC last December and in South Korea, there are already large funds offering Metaverse related ETF to customers.

In January, Microsoft announced the largest acquisition of its history, as it acquired video game company Activision Blizzard for almost $69 billion. This is considered by many as Microsoft’s bet on Metaverse and its ambition to have competitive edge in the Metaverse sector. In comparison, Nintendo holds a more conservative stance on Metaverse, as on 3rd of February, Nintendo President commented in a live Q&A session that Nintendo ‘sees the potential’, but will only expand into Metaverse, if this new concept can provide ‘surprise and fun’ expected by players. In a recent survey by the Game Developers Conference titled ‘State of the Game Industry 2022’, the opinions of 2700 game developers were sampled. It concludes that many traditional game developers are doubtful of cryptocurrency, gaming NFT and Metaverse. As 72% of the respondents say that their studio is ‘not interested’ in using cryptocurrency as a method of payment and 70% of them ‘not interested’ in NFTs with only 1% currently developing NFTs for their games. Furthermore, 30% of the developers think that Metaverse is overhyped and will fail to meet its promises.

As Meta (previously known as Facebook) released its earnings report on 2nd of February, its stock price plunged by 26%. The report revealed that firm spent $10 billion in 2021 on Reality labs, its division which focuses on products and services within the Metaverse, and it reported that Reality labs incurred a $3.3 billion loss in last quarter. After this report was released, leading metaverse cryptocurrencies also suffered depreciation in token prices – as SAND and AXS both dropped around 9% on the daily close.

Metaverse offers truly unique user experience comparing to current forms of entertainment, and hence its potential is widely regarded by investors, businesses and even some countries. However, through the hefty quarterly loss of Meta’s Reality labs, and strong pullbacks in market caps experienced by leading Metaverse cryptocurrencies, it is obvious that Metaverse is currently still a niche market in its infancy which may require years of development to meet its promises. This has also raised questions on whether the hype around Metaverse is overblown.
